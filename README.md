1. For 9/11 part of my project Zeitgeist_9_11.ipyn contains all the code used to gather data and organize it, as well as the graphs I used in the presentation. 
Zeitgeist_1997_2009.csv is the resulting data frame.

2. Zeitgeist_1950_2019.ipyn is the file containing all the code for my second question. Zeitgeist_1997_2009.csv is the corresponding data frame.

3. The third part of my project's code is contained in genre_popularity.ipyn with a coresponding csv file and a data base used to organize each genre, called genres.db.

In the future I would like to see if there is any relation between movie popularity Zeitgeist and movie rating Zeitgeist. My hypothesis is that we sick to run from reality watching movies but we rate movies by the way they reflect it. 
In the time of war we sick movies that are not about war but we rate movies about war the highest.
COVID19 will have the opposite effect on ratings. We will rate movies with hospital setting and about COVID battles the highest.
