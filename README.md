# Events-and-movies
The influence an event like 9/11 can have on movies.

I took 9/11 as an example but you could take any other event, even Coronavirus event.
I see this experiment like the testing of a medicine. 
You need a test group and I've chosen 1999-2001 as test years and I'll see what movies were released more. What genres are prevalent. 
Then I'll see the 2 years after the event: 2002 and 2003. What were the genres prevalent after 9/11.
1. Could it be that after 9/11 people wwere more atracted to war, action, violent movies.
2. Could it be that the movie makers will be tempted to avoid war movies? (We've had enough with this rough reality, we need more romance and fantasy movies)
3. What movies will have more succes (succes = gross income) after a certain event?
4. Can we draw a conclusions about the history of movies in the 1950-2020 period? Is there a pattern in the genre evolution?
